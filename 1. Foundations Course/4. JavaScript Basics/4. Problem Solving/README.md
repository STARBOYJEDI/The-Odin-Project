# Solving Fizz Buzz

#### Write a program that takes a user's input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## Writing the pseudocode
### What are the steps necessary to return the desired output? Here is an algorithm in pseudocode for this problem:
1. When a user inputs a number
2. Loop from 1 to the entered number
3. If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fuzz"
4. If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
5. If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
6. Otherwise print the current number
