# Creating a dynamic shopping list

## This is a simple project to create a dynamic shopping list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The shopping list allows users to add items, mark them as completed, and remove them from the list.

### Features:
- The item should appear in the list.
- Each item should have a button next to it that removes the item from the list when clicked.
- The input fields should be cleared and focused, ready for the next item entry.
